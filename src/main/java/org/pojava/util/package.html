<p>Util contains pure utility code. In general, when a POJava utility consists
    of only static methods, it will have the suffix "Tool" at the end.
</p>

<p>
    Note that these utilities don't exist to try to duplicate the efforts of Apache
    Commons or Guava, which are both excellent. Rather, they're intended to provide
    a small core on which to build some higher level tools without maintaining external
    dependencies
